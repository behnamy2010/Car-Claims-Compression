# A Systematic Survey and Empirical Comparison of Hybrid Methods for Imbalanced Fraud Detection

This repository contains the code and datasets for our paper, "A Systematic Survey and Empirical Comparison of Hybrid Methods for Imbalanced Fraud Detection: Combining Resampling and Machine Learning," published in the AUT Journal of Mathematics and Computing.

Fraud detection faces a critical hurdle: severe class imbalance. Our work systematically explores hybrid frameworks that combine resampling techniques with machine learning to overcome this challenge.
